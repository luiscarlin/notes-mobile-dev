# Ionic

- front end SDK to develop hybrid mobile apps with HTML5
  - hybrid app = native + web app
    - native = specific to platform
    - web app = genericm, multi-platform
- downstream Cordova app, so similar commands + new ones

```bash
# create ionic project
# project name = fp
# tempalte = blank
# ./fp/www/lib contains the ionic library (you can delete other content of www)
ionic start fp blank
```
